The focus is more on genetics and how genetic material is passed from parent cells to the daughter cells. A human has 48 chromosomes per somatic cell. Without meiosis, when a sperm and egg fuse to form a single zygote, there would be 4 copies of each chromosomes.
Meoisis ensures that when the gamete contains one representative of each homologous pair so that when they fuse, the resulting cell has the correct number of chromosomes In meiosis, the DNA is synthesized only once, but divides twice. It has the same same steps at mitosis, prophase, metephase, anaphase and telophase. Each of these stages occurs twice so there is, for example, meaphase I and metaphase II. In meiosis, prophase does not only include the chromosomes bounding together but also: Leptotene, Zygotene, Pachytene, Diplotene and Diakinesis. During lepotene the chromosomes become more visible and condense. Then in zygotene the homolgous chromosomes pair up. In pachytene the chromosomes form a tetrad and are fully lined up along their length. In diplotene the chromosomes begin to repel and finally in diakineses, the chromosomes become even shorter and the nuclear envelope breaks. This laboratory is going to show all of these steps to meiosis and how important it is to the development of living things.
In the second par of this laboratory, the students will be given a hypothetical chromosome spread. They are going to have to identify and number each of these chromosomes checking for any abnormalities. If there is an issue with the sex chromosomes there are four possible syndromes, either Turner syndrome, for an XO pair, Tripple X, Klinefelter syndrome for XXY or and XYY karyotype. Then the student would look for abnormalities in other chromosomes to indicate either Patau, Edwards and Down syndrome
