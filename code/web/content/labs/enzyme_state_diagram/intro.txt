This lab uses the Specronic 20 to quantify enzyme activity under different conditions. Students in this lab will have to prepare 6 test tubes each with a different combination of buffer and enzymes. Once all of this mixtures have been prepared, the test tubes absorbance is found using the spec 20. Depending on which test tube the student is testing, there will be a very different reading of absorbance and this will illustrate how different types of reagents and substrates will react.
The second part of this lab involves the students preparing six test tubes again, each with a different amount of undiluted enzyme from 100 percent to six percent. Once this has been completed, the substrate is added to begin the reaction. The spec 20 will be used to find the absorbance initially and then again after five minutes. This will allow the student to see how the concentration of the enzyme affects how quickly the reaction begins and how long it takes to complete.
