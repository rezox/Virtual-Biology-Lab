The goal of the first Laboratory is to demonstrate all of the stages of the type of nuclear division known as Mitosis. This lab will start with a demonstration of all of the steps of Mitosis, this starts with the Interphase stage where the cell is preparing for division, the cell increases in size and duplicates its chromosomes. The next stage is Prophase, this is when the chromosomes begin to bound together at their centromeres. During this stage the nuclear membrane disintegrates too. Next is the Metaphase where the chromosomes line up on the equatorial plane of the cell. Next is the Anaphase where the chromosomes are pulled apart and to opposite sides of the cell. This is where the cell has separated into two identical copies of genetic material. The last stage is the Telophase, this stage is the reversal of prophase and the two newly created cells settle down and a new nuclear membrane forms.
The second part of this lab is going to involve the student preparing a slide to view the stages of mitosis like how they would in a real laboratory. First they will check for the pH of the urine, making sure it is between a 5 and an 8. Secondly they will check for Glycosuria, making sure the amount of glucose per milliliter is about 0.6. Next, they will ensure the patient doesn’t have proteinuria, or an excess of 0.3 mg of albumin per milliliter. Lastly they will check for the color of the urine, making sure the patient doesn’t have hemoglobinuria. The last part of this laboratory will involve the students experimenting with carbohydrate and protein chemistry. in this part the student will be given a prepared test tube of some mixture an have to use the Spec 20 to figure out what the concentration is based on some example readings.
